Roadmap for facial recognition mini project
1. Study Tensorflow.js
2. Study and interface with face-api.js
3. Check tutorials of WebDevSimplified (Youtube and Github) on facial recognition and facial detection.
4. Implement a sample Facial recognition PoC using images (use sample images, family?) hosted in GCS public bucket
5. Extend the PoC to use video from webcam instead of stale images
6. Use CPS images instead of sample image and check loading time
7. Deploy in App Engine
8. Migrate the detection and recognition part in the backend using Node.JS and create an API
9. Frontend should only display video stream and detected faces using the face landmarks and a rectangle canvas on each face.
10. Video should run detection every 200ms and send the image from the stream to the NodeJS server.
11. Server does the facial recognition and saves the data in a DB
12. Frontend can pull the list of detected faces from DB
